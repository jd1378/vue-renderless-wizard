Thanks to contributors of bootstrap-vue, 
specially those who have worked on `<b-tabs>` and `utils` in the source.
I have used them in my code.
because probably I wouldn't be able to make this easily if I had not read their way of doing stuff.
Still this component does some stuff in It's own way which is not exactly what b-vue is doing.

I made this in my spare time with no real use case for it, so It may not be what you want exactly, but I tried to do it in a way that pleases more tastes than one.

I hope you enjoy using it.
